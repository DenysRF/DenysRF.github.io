                Everyone collects something, isn't that right? From post stamps to rocks, from vinyl to plants, from books to wrappings.. Well... I have started a collection as well.

                A collection of faces.
            </p>

                Yes you read it correctly! I have collected faces over the past couple of years. I have always had that urge to just, want to take a face that I thought interesting, intriguing, pretty, handsome or simply different in a good way, and just put it in my pocket. I remember literally telling my friends that I wanted to take someone's face with me and take it home to study and learn to draw it. It took some time before I realized that there was a way to start this collection. I was a little scared to start talking to those with the striking faces, but something made me step in their direction anyway. I started with a simple "hi" and explained to them that I really liked their face and that I would love to draw them. I asked if I could take their picture - don't look at me nor the camera, don't smile, let your face rest. After taking their picture, I collected their number so I could reach out to them after finishing the promised drawing.

                I have gotten to know some amazing people this way, and I'm glad to have found a way to start my very own collection of faces. It's a very personal collection, of course. It's a collection of faces that are striking to me. My own collection of faces to put in my pocket.
