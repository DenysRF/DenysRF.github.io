  text: <br><i>A chaos of floating memories</i>.<br><br><br><br><br><p>Initially, the <i>Dreamscapes</i> project started with drawings of oldtimers. I drew my associations with the cars around them and created a painted collage of surroundings and subjects. However, later in the process, I decided that some of the images were stronger without the cars and therefore I cut some of them out. I still like the left-out parts, so I will share some of these below.</p><br>
