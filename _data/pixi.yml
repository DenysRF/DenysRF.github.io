  text: "After graduating at the end of the summer of 2020, I started working on illustrations for the Pixi art competition.
  A few months passed after submitting my works until I received an email from Publisher De Vier Windstreken.
  I am happy to share with you that my drawings ended in the top ten!
  <br><br>
  The illustrations I made for the Pixi art competition were part of an exposition at the Central Library of Den Haag, the Netherlands.
  The xposition was held at the end of 2021.

  My participating illustrations can be found below.
