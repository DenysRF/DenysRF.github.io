            <p>
                <i>Dreamscapes</i> is a series of paintings that allows you to hop on my train of thought and see inside my brain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon seeing an object, an animal or a person, my brain associates the thing I see with all kinds of things that pop up in my head and follow each other up at a high speed. I like to imagine my brain as a universe of memories, objects and associations, and whenever I see or hear something, the train of thought takes off and races past all kinds of memories. 
                <br>This series shows my idea of the universe inside my brain and all the objects and memories that float in it.
